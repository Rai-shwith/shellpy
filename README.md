# 🐍 ShellPy: Python Scripts for Shell Enthusiasts 🚀

Welcome to the **ShellPy** repository, where Python meets shell scripting in the most delightful way! 🎉 Here, you'll find Python scripts designed to make your life easier, especially when managing directories and files. 

## 📂 Current Scripts

- **dirgen**: Create a directory and file structure using a simple Emmet-like syntax. Just type your structure, and watch the magic happen! 🪄

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rai-shwith/shellpy.git
   ```

2. **Add to Your PATH**:
   To make the `dirgen` command accessible from anywhere, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/shellpy:$PATH"
   ```

   Remember to run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.bash_profile`) to apply the changes immediately! 🎩✨

3. **Use the Scripts**:
   Now, you can use the `dirgen` command in your terminal like a pro! Just type:
   ```bash
   dirgen "<your-emmet-like-structure>"
   ```
